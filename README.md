1. Data Not Saving and Duplicate Emails

File: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
Severity: Critical
Status: ✅ Fixed

🔍 Problem

The lead capture form was not saving user data to the database and was sending duplicate confirmation emails upon submission.

🧠 Root Cause

The `handleSubmit` function in the `LeadCaptureForm` component was missing the call to insert data into the Supabase `leads` table. Additionally, it was calling the `send-confirmation` function twice.

🔧 Fix

Added the `supabase.from('leads').insert(...)` call to save the lead data. Removed the redundant call to the `send-confirmation` function.

📈 Impact

User data is now correctly saved to the database.
Users no longer receive duplicate confirmation emails.

2. Incorrect AI-Generated Content

File: `supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`
Severity: High
Status: ✅ Fixed

🔍 Problem

The personalized content generated by the AI for the confirmation email was not working correctly, and the fallback content was always being used.

🧠 Root Cause

The code was attempting to access the AI-generated content using the wrong index (`data?.choices[1]`). The correct index is `0`.

🔧 Fix

Changed the index to `0` to correctly access the AI-generated content: `data?.choices[0]?.message?.content`.

📈 Impact

The confirmation emails now include personalized content, improving the user experience.
